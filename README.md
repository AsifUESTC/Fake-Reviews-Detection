Fake Reviews Analysis: An Efficient Ensemble Approach for Fake Reviews Detection
This repository contains the implementation of my undergraduate final project focused on detecting fake reviews on online platforms. The project aims to provide an efficient ensemble approach that combines various machine learning models to improve the accuracy of fake review detection. The key steps in this project include data collection, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

üìå Overview
The project leverages an ensemble of classifiers (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines) to identify fake reviews based on textual and metadata features. Key highlights of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing a labeled dataset of reviews for model training.
Feature Engineering: Extracting both textual (e.g., sentiment analysis, n-grams, etc.) and metadata (e.g., reviewer information, review length) features for training.
Ensemble Learning: Combining multiple models to improve prediction performance by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

üìù Key Techniques
Textual Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF, sentiment analysis, and word embeddings to convert review text into machine-readable features.
Ensemble Classifiers: Combining models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM using stacking and bagging techniques.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluating the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
